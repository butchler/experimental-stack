* Set up eslint.
* Use a preprocessor like PreCSS to reduce duplication in CSS.
* Make cards have a fixed number of columns, determined when game, starts so
  that the card positions won't change if the user resizes their window in the
  middle of the game.
* Add animation when game starts/ends (such as cards flying in/out).
* Play sound effects when game starts/ends.
* Add decoration to backs of cards to make them look more like cards.
* Use owl.svg logo somewhere. (Maybe on the back of the cards?)
* Make it mobile friendly.
* Keep track of player's best time and best # attempts so far (via localStorage).
* Reimplement with Redux to compare Mobx vs. Redux.
